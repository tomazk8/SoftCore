IoC
Attribute-based part (class) registration over field only (Export, Import, ImprotMany), string contracts can be customized
Lifetime (Shared, NonShared, custom)
Lazy resolving
ExportFactory
Catalogs (Application, Assembly, Type, Aggregate, ExplicitInstance, Filter)
Replacement export - for testing
Floating parts - using special attribute
IEntryPoint
Constructor parameter injection - only over ExportFactory
AOP - interception on interfaces using proxy (Access control, logging/recording)
ImportExternal - using ExternalPartProvider

.NET standard

TODO:
